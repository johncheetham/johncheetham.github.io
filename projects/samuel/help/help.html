<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
There are many draughts variants. Samuel plays the version known as English draughts (also called American checkers).<br />
</p>
<h2>Board Numbering System</h2>
<p>
There is a standard numbering system where the squares are numbered from 1 to 32 as shown in the images below.
These numbers are used to show moves in the game information panel. They are also used when loading/saving games
in the standard format.<br />
</p>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>
<img src="Sam2.png" alt="Samuel Screen shot" /><br />
<br />The image above illustrates the various areas.
</p>
<h2>Setting the Players</h2>
<p>
Through the Options menu bar option you can set up the computer player.<br /><br />
The options are:
</p>
<ul class="bullets"> 
    <li>computer plays white - human player plays red against the computer</li>
    <li>computer plays red - human player plays white against the computer</li>
    <li>computer plays white and red - computer plays against itself</li> 
    <li>computer off - human plays against him/her self</li>    
</ul>
<p>
If you are playing as white against the computer you can enable the 'flip the board' feature so that
the white pieces are at the bottom of the board.
</p>
<h2>Setting the Computers Level of Play</h2>
<p>
The computers skill level depends on its search depth and time limit.<br />
It can use a search depth between 1 (weakest level of play) and 52 (strongest level of play).
<br /><br />
There are 3 preset skill levels:<br />
</p>
<ul class="bullets"> 
    <li>Beginner (search depth 2)</li>
    <li>Advanced (search depth 8)</li>
    <li>Expert   (search depth 52 time limited)</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is also a user-defined skill level which allows you to set a search depth between 1 and 52.
To set the lowest level use user-defined level and set the search depth to 1.
When using a high search depth the computer will take a long time to make its move. You can set a time limit to force it to
move within a certain time.
<br />
</p>
<h2>Position Edit</h2>
<p>
Go into position edit to add/remove pieces from the board and to change the side to move.
You can press the 'delete' key to remove all pieces and start with an empty board.
</p>
<h2>Change the Board Size</h2> 
<p>
To make the board bigger hold down CTRL and + keys.<br />
To make the board smaller hold down CTRL and - keys.<br />
To reset the board to normal size press CTRL and 0 keys.<br />
</p>
<h2>Information Panel</h2>
<p>
<img src="panel.png" alt="Information Panel image" /><br />
The information panel displays details of the computers move.<br /><br />
This example indicates that:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>there are 12 red pieces and 12 white pieces on the board</li>
<li>the skill level is set to expert</li>
<li>the computer is searching. i.e. still thinking about its move</li>
<li>the search depth is 20/30</li>
<li>the current best value from the evaluation function is -8</li>
<li>the current best move is from square 22 to square 18</li>
<li>the thinking time taken so far is 8.64 seconds</li>
<li>the number of KNodes (positions) searched so far is 54007</li>
<li>the search speed is 6250 KNodes (positions) per second</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can turn it on/off through the options on the menu bar.
</p> 
<h2>Status Bar</h2> 
<p>
The Status bar displays whose turn it is to move.<br />
You can turn it on/off through the options on the menu bar. 
</p>
<h2>Loading/Saving Games</h2>
<p>
Games can be loaded/saved using the File option on the menu bar.
Games are saved in the standard pdn format. The files will be saved with a .pdn extension. 
pdn files include the move history and you can rewind the game with the game review buttons.
<br />You can also copy/paste the game to/from the clipboard in the standard fen and pdn formats.
You can load games saved by other programs if they are in the standard format.

<h2>Opening Book</h2>
<p>
The file opening.gbk contains moves for the opening book.
<br /> It comes from guicheckers pre-seeded with opening moves.
<br /> 
<br /> You can modify it with these commands: 
</p>
<ul class="bullets"> 
    <li>'3' - Add Current Board position / adjust towards '0'</li>
    <li>'2' - Add/Adjust to being good for red</li>
    <li>'4' - Add/Adjust to being good for white</li>
    <li>'6' - Remove Position</li>
    <li>'K' - Clear Opening Book in memory</li>
    <li>'S' - Save Opening Book</li>
</ul>
<p>
When saving the opening book is saved to ~/.samuel/opening.gbk.
When loading at startup it's loaded first from ~/.samuel/opening.gbk.
If not found there it will be loaded from the same directory as the program.
After a standard install the program directory will be read only which is why
'save' always saves to ~/.samuel/opening.gbk.
<br /> 
<br /> Most people will not want to modify the opening book.
</p>
<h2>Endgame Databases</h2>
<p>
These are contained in the files 2pc.cdb, 3pc.cdb and 4pc.cdb.<br />
They can be created by running the program genalldatabases.
