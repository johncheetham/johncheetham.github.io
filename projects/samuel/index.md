                    I was looking into doing a draughts game for Linux. There are some strong
                    programs for windows but not so many for Linux. Some of the stronger windows programs
                    distribute their engine code as a dll which is good for other windows programs but not so 
                    good for an open source Linux application.<br /> <br />
             
                    Then I discovered <em>guicheckers</em> which is a draughts
                    program for windows that comes with source code and a good engine. I decided to convert
                    <em>guicheckers</em> to work under Linux and Samuel is the result. Samuel is <em>guicheckers for Linux</em>.<br /><br />
        
                    The C++ engine code, board graphics and databases (opening book and endgame) all come from guicheckers.
                    I wrote a new python / GTK front end gui with an interface that is very similar to guicheckers.<br /> <br />           
        
                    Thanks and credit to the <em>guicheckers</em> people (programming by Jon Kreuzer, graphics by Josh Hess) for
                    making their work available.<br /> <br />

                    Samuel is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a> an early pioneer
                    of computer draughts.
